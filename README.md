Brief Description: In this challenge, I created a neural network model that predicts whether a student borrower will repay their loan. I used various dataset features to predict these probabilities, and the model ended up receiving an accuracy score of around 76%, which is not bad. Finally, I also reflected on how I would build a recommendation system to tackle this loan topic, and the challenges that a project like that would face.
